## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
    ```env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

5. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to start using the app.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Your Request**: Describe your desired workout plan in natural language (e.g., "4-week intermediate upper body strength program")
2. **AI Generation**: The app uses LangChain and OpenAI to generate a structured workout plan matching your requirements
3. **View & Customize**: Navigate through weeks, view daily exercises, and delete exercises as needed
4. **Auto-Save**: Your workout plan is automatically saved to localStorage for future reference
